# CS6387_Final
For the Final Project in CS 6387, I would like to do an analysis of major breaches over the last year to identify trends and map those to the CIA triad and other concepts I’ll learn in this course. I would enjoy researching this topic of major breaches because it interests me to see how hackers are able to leak major data from such important companies. You wouldn’t think these big companies would be having any major breaches since these companies spend money on acquiring security for themselves. I was investigating the major breaches that have happened thus far in 2021, and there have been many fortune 500 companies breached. The worst data breaches of 2021 thus far includes Parlor (70TB of leaked information through a data scrape), US Cellular (hackers scammed employees into downloading malicious software on company computers), Kroger (3rd party company, Accellion,  had a data breach and it allowed hackers access to their HR and pharmacy records), Hobby Lobby (customer information database was exposed after a cloud-bucket misconfiguration), Facebook (533 million users information was leaked due to it being scraped in a patch vulnerability), LinkedIn (Over 500 million users’ account information was discoverable on the black market because of a data scrape), can’t forget about the famous Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack that happened back in May, and etc. What intrigues me the most is how most of the data breaches happened to technology companies, therefore I would like to dive deeper and relate how these attacks map/trend to the CIA triad and other concepts that I’ll learn in this course.
